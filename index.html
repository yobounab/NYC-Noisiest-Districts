  <p>A city that never sleeps is also a city that is never quiet. With the blaring sirens of firetrucks and ambulances, the ruckus of an approaching train, and the many dins of century-long constructions, New York City is an unrelenting symphony of obnoxious and unhealthy noises.</p>

  <p>But besides its rather innate sonic state, there are also noisy New Yorkers. And weary New Yorkers, on the other hand, are more and more inclined to file noise claims —which have been easier to do now than ever before.</p>

  <p>After the city changed its noise code for the first time in 30 years in 2007, filing a 311 complaint became simple and straightforward. Based on <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9">data</a> from December 1, 2020 to December 1, 2021, the <i>NYCity News Service</i> mapped the number of noise complaints filed in every borough of New York City.</p>

  <p>Displayed below, the map shows the number of complaints in each community district.</p>

  <iframe title="New York's Noisiest Community Districts" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-uHWa6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uHWa6/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="781"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

  <p>The city saw a total of 4,768,477 noise complaints during that period. This amounts to <b><u>nine complaints per minute</u></b>.</p>

  <p>Manhattan Community District 10, which includes the neighborhoods of Washington Heights and Inwood, saw the filing of most complaints, with a total 291,722.</p>

  <p>Thanks not in small part to Washington Heights and Inwood, as well as other neighborhoods like the East Village and the Upper West Side, Manhattan topped the list of boroughs with the most complaints, having had 1,831,359 complaints.</p>

  <p>Second was the Bronx, with 1,086,224 noise complaints filed during the same period, followed by Brooklyn with 1,309,503, Queens with 855,554, and Staten Island with just 120,505 complaints.</p>

  <p>While they cover more space than the average district elsewhere in the city, Staten Island’s community districts came respectively last, with Community District 03 having seen only 24,210 noise complaints.</p>

  <p>Maybe Staten Island isn’t that bad to live in after all.</p>
